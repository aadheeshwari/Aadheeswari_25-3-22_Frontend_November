1) Explain about componentDidUpdate in updating phase?


    => The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

    => The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:

    => When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".

    => When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and the color becomes "yellow".

    => This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a componentDidUpdate method, this method is 
executed and writes a message in the empty DIV element
